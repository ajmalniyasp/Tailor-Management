## 🧪 Branching Strategy

We follow a structured branching model with the following types:

- [x] **Development** – Default working branch  
- [x] **feature/** – For adding new features  
- [x] **bugfix/** – For fixing identified bugs  
- [x] **release/** – For releasing stable builds

## ✨ Adding a New Feature
```bash
    # Step 1: Checkout the default branch
        git checkout Development
        git pull

    # Step 2: Create a new feature branch
        git checkout -b feature/short-feature-name

    # Step 3: Write your code and commit
        git add -A
        git commit -m "Added: short description"

    # Step 4: Push and create Merge Request
        git push origin feature/short-feature-name
```

➡ Go to **GitLab ➝ Merge Requests ➝ New Merge Request**  
➡ Choose your source branch (`feature/short-feature-name`) and target branch (`Development`)  
➡ Fill in the title and description

**Then:**
- 🧑‍💼 **Select a Reviewer** from the dropdown list (person who will review your code)
- 🙋 **Assign Yourself** in the **Assignee** dropdown

➡ Click **Submit Merge Request**

➡ Wait for **Maintainer approval and merge**

```bash
    # Step 5: After merge, update local Development branch
        git checkout Development
        git pull
```

## 🐞 Fixing a Bug
```bash
    # Step 1: Checkout the default branch
        git checkout Development
        git pull

        git checkout -b bugfix/short-bug-name
    
    # fix the issue...

    # Step 3: Write your code and commit
        git add -A

    # Step 4: Push and create Merge Request
        git push origin bugfix/short-bug-name
```

➡ Go to **GitLab ➝ Merge Requests ➝ New Merge Request**

## 🚢 Creating a Release
#### Only maintainer have permissions to go with this step
```bash
    # Step 1: Checkout the default branch
        git checkout Development
        git pull
    
    # Step 2: Create a new release branch
        git checkout -b release/1.0.0
        
        # ensure no pending bugs
        
    # Step 3: If no bugs in your code then commit
        git add -A
        git commit -m "Release: version 1.0.0"

    # Step 4: Push and create Merge Request
        git push origin release/1.0.0
```

## 🔁 Merge Request Flow

| Action | Who |
|--------|-----|
| Create MR | Developer |
| Review + Approve | Maintainer |
| Merge | Maintainer |
| Pull latest changes | Developer (post-merge) |

✅ Developers cannot push directly to protected branches (`Development`, `Production`, etc.)  
✅ Only Maintainers can approve and merge MRs.

---


## 📌 Best Practices

- Always pull the latest `Development` before creating new branches
- Keep commit messages meaningful and concise
- Use Merge Requests for **all changes**
- Do **not force push** to protected branches
